<h2> Hall Middle School Math Festival Dec 1, 2023</h2>

We hope you enjoyed the festival! We would like to thank the following people for their help today.
- Principal Toni Brown of Hall Middle School, and the mathematics teachers, especially Katie Tobes, for providing facilities and other support, and of course, giving up their math classes so that their students could attend the festival.
- The USF Math Circles class (math 314) under the supervision of Professor Sam Roven, in particular his students Emelia Baumann, Eleanor Christman, Frances Grout, Daniel Matthews, and Chloe Pine
- High school students Madhava Brahmandan and Emily Marton
- Molly Roven
- The continuing inspiration of the [National Museum of Mathematics](https://www.momath.org) 
- Master teacher Henri Picciotto's [amazing body of work](https://www.mathed.page/index.html)

Here is the a [handout](HallMSMathFestival/HallMS231201Festival.pdf) which describes some of the activities. The table below has handouts and links with more information, including some spoilers.

|Geometric Puzzles| To learn more about pentominoes and pattern blocks, please check out Henri Picciotto's [amazing resources](https://www.mathed.page/index.html). In particular, he has many lovely [pictures](https://www.mathed.page/manipulatives/pattern-blocks/dodecagons/index.html) showing different dodecagon tilings, and has lots of [resources](https://www.mathed.page/puzzles/pento-books/index.html) about pentominoes. There is a massive literature about the SOMA cube, which was invented by the Danish scientist Piet Hein. Here is a reprint of a 1961 [article](https://www.fam-bundgaard.dk/SOMA/NEWS/Gardner%20on%20SOMA.pdf) about it written for *Scientific American* by [Martin Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner), perhaps the greatest mathematical expositor in history.|
|Games of little or no chance| [math magic for muggles](MitM/mathmagic.pdf) and [handout with solutions](MitM/mathmagicSol.pdf)|
|Mathematical magic for muggles| [Scissors congruence](MitM/dissections.pdf) and [a solutions file from an old SF session](MitM/scissorsSolA.pdf)|
|The cautious driver's maze| This is one of many wonderful activities created by the [National Museum of Mathematics](https://www.momath.org). If you cannot visit the museum in person, visit their gift shop online!|
|Mathematical origami| Here is Molly Roven's [handout](HallMSMathFestival/math-origami-compressed.pdf), and here is just [one](http://origametry.net/phzig/phzig.html) of many great links about mathematical origami.  We also recommend the book *Project Origami* by Thomas Hull. |
|Rational tangles|Here is a neat [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE38AXV_dHc&t=1793s) of Tom Davis teaching teachers about rational tangles. Visit his [website](http://www.geometer.org) for tons of great resources, including a nice [paper](http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/tangle.pdf) about rational tangles.|
|Minimal surfaces with soap films|There are many nice videos and articles; [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsiDR2JBctw) is one of the clearest.  To make your own bubble solution use Dawn dishwashing liquid, glycerin, and water in the ratio 1:1:8.|
