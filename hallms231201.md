<h2> Hall Middle School Math Festival Dec 1, 2023</h2>

We hope you enjoyed the festival! We would like to thank the following people for their help today.
- Principal Toni Brown of Hall Middle School, and the mathematics teachers, especially Katie Tobes, for providing facilities and other support, and of course, giving up their math classes so that their students could attend the festival.
- The USF Math Circles class (math 314) under the supervision of Professor Sam Roven, in particular his students Emelia Baumann, Eleanor Christman, Frances Grout, Daniel Matthews, and Chloe Pine
- High school students Madhava Brahmandan and Emily Marton
- Molly Roven
- The continuing inspiration of the [National Museum of Mathematics](https://www.momath.org) 
- Master teacher Henri Picciotto's [amazing body of work](https://www.mathed.page/index.html)

Here is the a [handout](HallMSMathFestival/HallMS231201Festival.pdf) which describes some of the activities. The table below has handouts and links with more information, including some spoilers.
