<h2> Desert Island Math, May 2, 2022 (Polyhedra)</h2>

Please visit MoMath's link which contains some my [videos](https://momath.org/videos/videos-events-with-paul-zeitz/). 
You may find the "Jump-In Geometry" series to be worth visiting.

To learn about polyhedra, you have to build them. *Polyhedral Models* by Wenninger is an excellent book.  
You should also buy some [zometools](http://zometool.com).
Additionally, you may want to play with a virtual zometools platform like [vzome](https://www.vzome.com/home/), but you *must* build physical models to build your 
intuition.

Coxeter's classic *Regular Polytopes* is advanced, but worth looking at. It's beautifully written. 

I've used a number of GeoGebra files to produce today's program, and am sharing my [dodecahedron](https://www.geogebra.org/classic/d6f8cabe)and
[icosahedron](https://www.geogebra.org/classic/f3kxuasc) files.
