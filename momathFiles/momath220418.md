We strongly recommend Tristan Needham's *Visual Differential Geometry and Forms: A Mathematical Drama in Five Acts*. This book is quite advanced, but
has lots of excellent prose and brilliant diagrams and will be something that you can read and reread and continue learning from.

A less advanced, but not easy book is *Stories about Maxima and Minima* by Tikhomirov.

I used many Geogebra files to do this program, but the most useful one to share with you is [the one that constructs the Fermat point of a triangle](https://www.geogebra.org/classic/ryqtqjwq).
