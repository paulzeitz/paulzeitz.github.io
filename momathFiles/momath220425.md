<h2> Desert Island Math, April 25, 2022 (Geometric Constructions)</h2>

Please visit MoMath's link which contains some my [videos](https://momath.org/videos/videos-events-with-paul-zeitz/). You may find the "Jump-In Geometry" series to be worth visiting.

A classic translation of Euclid's work is Thomas Heath.  You can buy an inexpensive paperback set (3 volumes) from Dover.  Heath is complete and correct, but rather dry and hard to read. An interesting alternative is the amazing books by Oliver Bryne, who published a version of the first 3 (out of 13) books of Euclid in the mid-1800s that uses  *beautiful* colored illustrations instead of words and symbols. You can see the original [here](https://archive.org/details/firstsixbooksofe00byrn/page/n5/mode/2up) and there is also a lovely interactive modernized version [here](https://www.c82.net/euclid/).  **Highly recommended!**

I have made my GeoGebra constructions "sandbox" [shareable](https://www.geogebra.org/classic/k8zp96vz).
