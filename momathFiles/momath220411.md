I have made my "sandbox" in **CoCalc (Sage)** public. Here is the [link](https://cocalc.com/share/public_paths/7fdadcbc8c6b6ae9b5af82b34a1a56e4e55c1298). Get your own account by going to Cocalc.com, and then you can copy my file and modify it. When you go to the link, you get the latest version that I have made.
