<h2> Desert Island Math, April 11, 2022 (Squares and Cubes)</h2>


I have made my "sandbox" in **CoCalc (Sage)** public. Here is the [link](https://cocalc.com/share/public_paths/7fdadcbc8c6b6ae9b5af82b34a1a56e4e55c1298). Get your own account by going to Cocalc.com, and then you can copy my file and modify it. When you go to the link, you get the latest version that I have made.  This version has some code for exploring the sticky square, and for seeing which numbers can be written as the sum of two squares.

I did a program on October 28, 2020 on "Geometry and Number Theory" in which I presented a fun geometric proof of Fermat's Christmas theorem.  [Here](https://momath.org/videos/videos-mathematical-fusion/) is a link for the video.

[Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20110822151104/http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/papers/right-size.html) is a link for Haldane's essay "On Being the Right Size."  Also take a look at an [essay](https://hermiene.net/essays-trans/size_and_shape.html) by the great late science writer Stephen Jay Gould.
