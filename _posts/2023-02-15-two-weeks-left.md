subtitle: And registrations closes in a week!

If you have already registered, you don't need to do so again.   If you have not registered, please do so soon, by 
filling out the registration form on  our [APPLY](https://www.bamo.org/apply/) page.  **Registrations closes on Feb 22.**

Note, *this registration form is  only for schools and math circles, not individuals or home-schooled students.* 
If you are an individual who needs to find a proctoring site, then please read the previous post that lists open proctoring sites.

Starting in a few days,  we will send Excel spreadsheets to each registered proctor, containing ID numbers for their students to use, 
along with complete proctoring instructions, which includes how to upload student solution papers.  The procedure is the same as last year's, but 
if you are new to BAMO or did not participate last year, please read these instructions carefully.  
All solution papers will be scanned and uploaded (no snail mail).
