As you probably know, MSRI in Berkeley has hosted our awards ceremony since 2006, but the pandemic has prevented that this year.  However, we are very happy 
to report that [Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu) will be able to host our event on **Sunday 20 Mar from 230--5PM**.

The location is **Daly Hall, room 207**.  Free parking is available at the nearby [North Campus Garage](https://www.scu.edu/map/parking#), located at the intersection of Alvisio and Benton.

The talk  will be given by **Alon Amit (Intuit)** on "The changing nature of proof."

After the talk, we will have a brief awards ceremony.
