Registration has closed for new proctoring sites.  But if you are a *student* who wants to take BAMO, you still can! 

A few institutions have indicated that they *may* be able to accept outside students, and we have
listed them [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VH8YX5ks0XkdwAcdIodftHfFOaErFbCyAp0mY-RIaL8/edit?usp=sharing). 
Please contact them on your own ASAP, and be aware that there is still very limited availability, 
and that it is a first-come, first-served situation. 

We wish that it is easier to take BAMO, but the pandemic has made it very difficult for most schools to open their doors to non-students.
