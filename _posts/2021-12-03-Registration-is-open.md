Happy holidays! We hope that you are staying safe and healthy and relatively sane in these interesting times. While the future is somewhat uncertain,  we are planning to go ahead with BAMO 2022 on March 2. It will be an in-person exam, proctored at schools and math circles on the west coast. Please visit our
