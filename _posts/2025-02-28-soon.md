title: How to succeed at BAMO
subtitle: BAMO is in a few days!
---

We hope that you enjoy the 26th BAMO, which takes place in less than a week (March 5). If you have never participated in an exam like BAMO, it can take some adjustment.  Remember, there are only five questions, and 
you have a four-hour time limit!  You are encouraged to think deeply, and then to *carefully* write up your solution.  

Take a look at this nice [essay](https://artofproblemsolving.com/blog/articles/how-to-write-a-solution), written by Richard Rusczyk and Matthew Crawford of
the [Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com), to get some advice about how to write a solution that is readable, clear, and---hopefully---correct!

And don't forget to come to the awards ceremony at Santa Clara University on Sunday, March 16 from 2--4PM, featuring a cool math talk by [Steve Trettel](https://stevejtrettel.site) of
the University of San Francisco. We will post more information about the awards ceremony next week.
