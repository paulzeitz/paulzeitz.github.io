If you have already registered, you don't need to do so again. 
Note, *this registration form is  only for schools and math circles, not individuals or home-schooled students.* 
If you are an individual who needs to find a proctoring site, then see below.

In the past, a number of schools and math circles have been able to accommodate students from schools that cannot host BAMO. 
Luckily, a few institutions have indicated that they *may* be able to accept outside students, 
and we have listed them [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QtRMueqnO3bR9YUQuMRr82mUQehjFUwLFYYG1SJlQmo/edit?usp=sharing). 
This list includes schools in the following locations:
- East Bay
- South Bay 
- Peninsula
- San Francisco
- Santa Cruz
- Seattle
- Los Angeles.

Please contact them on your own, and be aware that there is still very limited availability, and that it is a first-come, first-served situation. 
The information is still incomplete, but please return to this website for updates.  *Please contact one school at a time; don't bombard them all with requests.  Wait to hear from a school for confirmation and details.*

If you live outside the locations mentioned above, please contact us by email and we will see what we can do.  

We wish that it is easier to take BAMO, but the lingering effects of the pandemic has continued to make it  difficult for most schools to open their doors to non-students.
