The awards ceremony for the 24th BAMO will take place on Sunday, March 19 from 230-430PM at Santa Clara University in Daly Science 207.
The BAMO awards ceremony tradition is to have an excellent mathematical talk, followed by announcement of awards.  This year, our speaker will be
**Inna Zakaharevich** of Cornell University, the second speaker who actually took BAMO (can you name the other speaker?).  The title of her talk is 


*Solving polynomials with origami (or: things you can do when you lose your compass).*

More details as we approach March 19.  Meanwhile, good luck with BAMO on March 1!
