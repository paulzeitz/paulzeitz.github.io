title: BAMO 2023 T-shirts for sale
subtitle: Stay tuned for more shirts later
---

We regret that we could not make T-shirts available for free for all participants, but we are keeping the T-shirt [site](https://www.customink.com/g/cvx0-00cq-yx3y) open until May 19 for anyone who wishes to purchase shirts.

BAMO is a free event, and depends on the generosity of private donations and the support of SLMath.  Towards this end, we hope to have a small fundraiser later where we will make some "classic" shirts from the past available for purchase, with some of the purchase price used as a fundraiser.  Stay tuned for details.
