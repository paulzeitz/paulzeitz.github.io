As you probably know, MSRI in Berkeley has hosted our awards ceremony since 2006, but the pandemic has prevented that this year.  However, we are very happy 
to report that [Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu) will be able to host our event on **Sunday 20 Mar from 230--5PM**.

The location is **Daly Hall, room 207**.  Free parking is available at the nearby [North Campus Garage](https://www.scu.edu/map/parking#), located at the intersection of Alvisio and Benton.

The talk  will be given by **Alon Amit (Intuit)** on "The changing nature of proof."
*Proofs are the essence of mathematical progress. The nature of “proof” has been relatively stable for millennia, but is now changing due to a confluence of two factors: the increasing complexity and specialization of mathematical research, and the emergence of proof assistants and computer-verified proofs. We will explore those developments and study the possible role of Lean for the near future of mathematical progress. *

After the talk, we will have a brief awards ceremony.

To sign up, please [RSVP](https://forms.gle/4c1aDtyERukjFSuo8) as soon as possible, since space may be limited due to the pandemic. Be prepared to show proof of vaccination and wear a mask.
