The Scores and awards report for the 25th BAMO is posted in our Archives tab.  This will help you to interpret your score.  

What if you did not receive your score?  We sent them out on Sunday 17 Mar by email. 
If you did not receive it, that is because you either did not give your proctor the right email, or they copied it incorrectly.  Please check with the proctor of the site
where you took BAMO.  They received all the scores for their site.

Soon we will send prize information to award winners. 
The Art of Problem Solving will be sending all participants who scored at least 7 points gift certificates for AoPS courses.  Stay tuned (by email).
