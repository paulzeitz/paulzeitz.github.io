A large crowd attended the 23rd BAMO awards ceremony on Sunday Mar 20, 2022 at Santa Clara University.  If you missed it, 
you can download a program  [here](/archives/winners/BAMO2022AwardsProgram.pdf).

Scores have been sent out to all participants and all proctors. For more detailed results (somewhat similar to the awards ceremony, but with some extra data),
please visit the **Archives** tab or go directly [here](/archives/winners/BAMO2022-award-report.pdf).

We thank the 500 participants and their teachers and parents.  We hope that you enjoyed BAMO 2022. Please visit this website in December to get information about 
BAMO 2023!
