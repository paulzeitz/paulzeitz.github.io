title: 2023 Awards Ceremony, Sunday 19 Mar
subtitle: The room has reached capacity!
---
The awards ceremony for the 24th BAMO will take place on Sunday, March 19 from 230-430PM at Santa Clara University in Daly Science 207.

The number of  people  that have signed up to attend the awards ceremony has reached the capacity of the room, so we are not accepting any more RSVPS unless we 
can find an overflow room.  Sorry about this. We cannot overcrowd the venue, due to pandemic restrictions. 

In the evening after the awards ceremony, official solutions will be posted on the webpage and scores will be emailed to participants (if you gave us an email address).  We will also send scores to the proctors of each site that hosted BAMO.
