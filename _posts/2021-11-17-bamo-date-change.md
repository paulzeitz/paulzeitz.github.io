subtitle: BAMO will take place on Wed 2 Mar, not Wed 23 February 2022!

After we announced our 23 Feb date, we received feedback from some schools complaining that this conflicted with February vacation week.  In the interest of broadening participation, we are moving the exam to **Wednesday 2 March, 2022**. The awards ceremony will take place on **Sunday 13 March, 2022** as planned, but at this time we do not know if it will be an in-person event hosted at MSRI or a virtual event.

The exam, however, will be in-person. Participants will need to take the exam at schools or math circles (in-person, not online) where they can be proctored.
