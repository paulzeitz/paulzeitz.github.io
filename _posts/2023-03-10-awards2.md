The awards ceremony for the 24th BAMO will take place on Sunday, March 19 from 230-430PM at Santa Clara University in Daly Science 207. Free parking is available at the nearby North Campus Garage, located at the intersection of Avisio and Belton.

The BAMO awards ceremony tradition is to have an excellent mathematical talk, followed by announcement of awards.  This year, our speaker will be
**[Inna Zakaharevich](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~zakh/)** of Cornell University, the second speaker who actually took BAMO (can you name the other speaker?).  The title of her talk is 


*Solving polynomials with origami (or: things you can do when you lose your compass).*

Seating is limited and we cannot overcrowd the venue, due to pandemic restrictions. If you wish to attend the ceremony, **please RSVP as soon as possibl**e with this [form](https://forms.gle/SCMXj1v4rjzJeqto9).

In the evening after the awards ceremony, official solutions will be posted on the webpage and scores will be emailed to participants (if you gave us an email address).  We will also send scores to the proctors of each site that hosted BAMO.
