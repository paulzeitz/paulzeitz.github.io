subtitle: BAMO is in a week!

We hope that you enjoy the 25th BAMO. If you have never participated in an exam like BAMO, it can take some adjustment.  Remember, there are only five questions, and 
you have a four-hour time limit!  You are encouraged to think deeply, and then to *carefully* write up your solution.  
Take a look at this nice [essay](https://artofproblemsolving.com/blog/articles/how-to-write-a-solution), written by Richard Rusczyk and Matthew Crawford of
the [Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com), to get some advice about how to write a solution that is readable, clear, and---hopefully---correct!
