You can download a program for the Mar 20, 2022 Awards Ceremony [here](/archives/winners/BAMO2022AwardsProgram.pdf).

If you have not RSVPed to the awards ceremony on Sunday 20 Mar, it is now too late.  
Sorry, but we have reached capacity for the room that we have reserved on the Santa Clara University campus. 
If you are unable to attend the awards ceremony, we will post results on this website and send out prizes electronically early next week.
