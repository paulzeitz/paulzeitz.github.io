If you have already registered, you don't need to do so again. If you haven't please do so soon. Registration will close in a week or so!
Note, *the registration form is  only for schools and math circles, not individuals or home-schooled students.* 

Next week we will send all registered exam sites all the materials needed to administer BAMO (the exams, password-locked until the day before exam day), a form for inputting student names, etc.
Full instructions are available [here](/proctor)
