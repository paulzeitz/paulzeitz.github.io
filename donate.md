<h2> Donate </h2>

Since its inception more than twenty years ago, BAMO has been a collaboration between [MSRI](https://www.msri.org/), local mathematicians and teachers, and local universities. In particular, we thank Mills College, UC Berkekely, San Jose State University, Stanford University, and the University of San Francisco for hosting awards ceremonies prior to 2006 and providing other institutional support.

Many generous individuals and foundations have supported BAMO over the years.  We are especially grateful to Nancy Blachman, Tom Davis and Ellyn Bush, Peggy and Tom Rike, Tim and Barbara Sylvester, Alexander Vaschillo, and  Jonathan Zhu.
