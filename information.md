title: About BAMO

The Bay Area Mathematical Olympiad (BAMO) is an annual competition for hundreds of Bay Area middle and high school students, consisting of 5 essay-proof math problems with a time limit of 4 hours. It is typically held on the last Tuesday of every February.  The exams are proctored at schools and at several open sites around the Bay Area. They are graded the following weekend by a group of Bay Area mathematicians, teachers, and Math Circle enthusiasts.
The BAMO awards ceremony, hosted at the [Mathematical Sciences Research Institute](https://www.msri.org/web/cms) in Berkeley on the weekend after the grading, has become an annual focal point for the Bay Area middle and high school math activities; about 200 students, teachers and parents gather for an exciting afternoon of mathematics, including a  talk by a distinguished mathematician. 

The first BAMO competition was on February 23, 1999, and was an outgrowth of the development of the [Berkeley Math Circle](https://mathcircle.berkeley.edu) and other math outreach initiatives led by [Zvezdelina Stankova](https://math.berkeley.edu/~stankova/), [Paul Zeitz](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/paul-zeitz) with the support of the [Mathematical Sciences Research Institute](https://www.msri.org/web/cms) in Berkeley
