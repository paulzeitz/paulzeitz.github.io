The Bay Area Mathematical Olympiad (BAMO) is an annual competition for hundreds of Bay Area middle and high school students, consisting of 5 proof-type math problems with a time limit of 4 hours. It is typically held on the last Tuesday of every February. This year's test will be on February 28, 2017. The exams are proctored at schools and at several open sites around the Bay Area. They are graded the following weekend by a group of Bay Area mathematicians, teachers, and Math Circle enthusiasts.
The BAMO awards ceremony, which takes place the weekend after the grading, has become an annual focal point for the Bay Area middle and high school math activities; about 200 students, teachers and parents gather for an exciting day of Mathematics, including a math talk by a distinguished mathematician.
