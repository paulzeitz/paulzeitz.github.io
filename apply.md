Registration for BAMO 2022 is now open! The exam will take place on March 2, 2022 during a 4-hour window between 12 and 8PM, Pacific Time. A few important points.
* The exam will be proctored *in person*.
* The proctoring location must be a school or math circle or similar educational institution.
* We do not allow proctoring at home. If you are homeschooled, you must find a location that will proctor the exam. We will collect information about possible sites and put this on the website.
* The exams will be sent to the proctor electronically, and the solution papers will be scanned and sent to us for grading. We will provide instructions for this later.
* At this time, we are restricting participation to CA, OR, and WA. For schools outside this area, feel free to regisiter, but we cannot guarantee that we will grade your exams. We need to see how many participants we have, and how many graders we can recruit.
