*Math in the Mountains* (MitM) is a new week-long math camp conceived by Paul Zeitz and Andrew Chung that will feature a unique mix of teachers, kids, and parents with a deep passion for mathematics, based at the Teton Science Schools (TSS) in Jackson Hole.  We plan to host a small number of teachers from Wyoming and Montana along with a small family camp featuring  young "math kids" and their parents.

The program will be led by a group of leading math educators who include the founder and faculty members from the Proof School; former coach of the USA Math Olympiad team (and USAMO winner); instructors who have taught at Epsilon Camp, Campersand, and MathCamp; applied mathematicians with investing and entrepreneurial backgrounds; and the main force behind the Global Math Project.  The number of campers is deliberately very small, ensuring an unusually high instructor-to-camper ratio and significant attention to each child and parentâ€™s needs.  Instruction will take place from the classrooms at TSS to outdoor locations in nearby Grand Teton National Park to create a unique environment for mathematical discourse.
