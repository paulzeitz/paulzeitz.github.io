<h1> Frequently asked questions</h1>


<details><summary><font size="+2"><b>Registration and eligibility</b></font></summary>
<ul>
  <li><details><summary><i>Who is eligible?</i> </summary>
BAMO-12 is for anyone who is in grade 12 or below (full-time college students are not eligible, but if a high school student is taking some college courses while still in high school, that is OK).  
BAMO8 is for anyone who is in grade 8 or below, unless they have previously scored a top award in BAMO-8.  
Originally, BAMO was restricted to students in schools in the San Francisco Bay Area.  In recent years, we have slowly expanded eligibility to include a few schools in the Pacific Northwest and Southern California. The number of students that we accomodate depends on how many people we have to grade the exams, so we cannot guarantee registration to all.  Just ask!
    </details></li>
  <li><details><summary><i>How do I register?</i> </summary>
Registration is done by schools or proctoring centers, such as math circles. We  send out an email in December to schools/proctoring centers that have been involved with BAMO in the past to register students to take the exam. We also will have the registration questionnaire available on the web site in December. The school/proctoring site needs a designated proctor who will administer the exam on-site.

    </details></li>
 <li><details><summary><i>What if I am a student at a school and I cannot find a proctor?</i> </summary>
In this case, we will attempt to match you with a proctoring site nearby.  Usually another school or math circle will accommodate you. Most years, we have several dozen sites.
    </details></li>
 <li><details><summary><i>What if I am home schooled? Can my parent or guardian be the proctor?</i> </summary>
In this case, you will not be able to take the exam at home.  You will need to find a nearby center to accommodate you.

<details><summary><font size="+2"><b>The BAMO Exam</b></font></summary>
<ul>
<li><details><summary><i>How many people take the BAMO exam?</i> </summary>
 During each of the past few years, nearly 500 people took BAMO-8 and about 200     took BAMO-12.
   </details></li>
<li><details><summary><i>How do the BAMO-8 and BAMO-12 exams differ?</i> </summary>
    Both exams have 5 questions, with a four-hour time limit. The BAMO-8 problems are labeled A, B, C, D, E, in increasing order of difficulty. The BAMO-12 problems are labeled 1--5, in increasing order of difficulty, and generally the last two problems of BAMO-8 and the first two problems of BAMO-12 overlap, so that problems C, D, E in BAMO-8 are, respectively, problems 1, 2, 3 in BAMO-12.
  </details></li>
  <li><details><summary><i>What kind of problems are on the exam?</i> </summary> 
    BAMO-8 problems include questions from logic, simple geometry, basic counting, and some algebra.  BAMO-12 problems may involve more advanced algebra, such as complex numbers, and possibly trigonometry, along with more advanced geometric ideas and more adanced counting concepts (more formally, combinatorics). No problems use or involve calculus. Please see our archive of <a href="https://paulzeitz.github.io/archives/problems_and_solutions/">past problems and solutions</a> for examples.
  </details></li>
<li><details><summary><i>How hard are the problems?</i> </summary> 
    The key word is "problem." A <i>problem</i>, in contrast to an <i>exercise</i>, is a mathematical question that requires <i>investigation</i> to solve. BAMO consists of, we hope, challenging and interesting problems. Usually the majority  of the participants   solve or make very significant progress on the first problem in their exam, but   only a handful (perhaps 1 out of 50) make any progress with the last problem.
  </details></li>
 <li><details><summary><i>Why are those last problems so hard?</i> </summary> 
    We have a very diverse group of participants.  Many are inexperienced folks that are relatively new to problem solving mathematics. For these students, we want to provide interesting problems that are relatively easy to investigate and enjoy.  But some participants are extremely experienced and highly skilled, including a few that are hoping to qualify for national or even international competitions. Therefore, some of our problems need to be so "hard" that they will separate the really experienced  from the extraordinarily experienced people.  We don't expect most participants to solve these problems during the time limit, but we try to make thse "hard" problems interesting to all.  We hope that even if you haven't solved a problem during the exam that you continue to think about it and perhaps discuss it with others.
  </details></li>

<li><details><summary><i>How are the problems graded?</i> </summary>  
    Each problem is worth 7 points, so a perfect score is 35 points.  Perfect scores are rare; perhaps one or two participants achieve this.  The median score is usually around 7 points (i.e., about half the students solve more than one problem, and about half solve less than one problem).
    </details></li>
<li><details><summary><i>If this exam is so hard, why should I take it? I won't win!</i> </summary>  
    "Winning" is not the point! BAMO is a fun challenge. For most people, even people who love math, it is a new experience to spend four hours doing nothing but thinking deeply about mathematics. And you will meet other people who share your interests.  And the awards ceremony, open to all participants, is another great experience.
   </details></li>
  <li><details><summary><i>Tell me more about the awards ceremony. Are there prizes?</i> </summary>  
    A week or so after the graders finish their work, we have an awards ceremony (held at <a href="https://www.msri.org">MSRI</a> since 2006) that features a talk by an excellent mathematician, followed by announcements of the top scoring individuals and teams. Prize winners receive cash, books, certificates, sometimes trophies or mathematical scultpures. Winning teams get certificates for food.  While it is certainly an honor to get an award, the real point of the awards ceremony is to celebrate mathematics itself. <a href="https://paulzeitz.github.io/archives/speakers/">Here</a>  is list of past speakers.
