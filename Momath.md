* The single best resource for Tracks of Galileo is the wonderful [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cld0p3a43fU) that 3Blue1Brown made with Momath's own Steve Strogatz.
* I strongly recommend that you play with the free grapher [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com).
* My **Geogebra** files 
  * that demonstrated Mark Levi's proof of the cycloid equation is [here](https://www.geogebra.org/classic/ueaxvvdz).
  * that shows the forces on the [catenary](https://www.geogebra.org/classic/wjpuajgm)
  * that [develops](https://www.geogebra.org/classic/setyhswh) the differential equation for the square-wheeled trike surface
  * that [explains](https://www.geogebra.org/classic/e8m9jsvk) the derivatives of sine and cosine with just geometry
* To use **Processing**, go to the Processing [website](https://processing.org) to download their software
  * [Here](momathFiles/descent_220311.pde) is my brachistochrone processing file.
* I have made my "sandbox" in **CoCalc (Sage)** public. Here is the [link](https://cocalc.com/share/public_paths/7fdadcbc8c6b6ae9b5af82b34a1a56e4e55c1298). Get your own account by going to Cocalc.com, and then you can copy my file and modify it. When you go to the link, you get the latest version that I have made.
